        <h2>How was the vote spread among counties in the Alabama 2017 Special Election?</h2>
        <p>To answer this I had to scrape a table from CNN and convert it to a CSV. As opposed to getting each counties results
        one by one from the Alabama state department. I then added a column to the table to give a % margin of victory in order
        to shade each county. Lastly, I merged this with US Census county shapes which I was able to merge in Google Fusion and
        filter down to Alabama counties.</p>
